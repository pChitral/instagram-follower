# Automatically Follow Users on Instagram
## How to use this?
All you need is a web browser to use this code.
1. Press <code> "Ctrl + shift + I" </code> or manually open your browser's console.
2. Copy-paste the code from the instagramFollow.js file.

## Things to remember
Use this code after clicking "See All", which sits right next to the "Suggestions For You", which gets displayed as you log into your account using the browser. However, this code works perfectly fine when explicitly run for a user of your choice. For example, if you wish to follow users that my Instagram account suggests, the URL will look like "https://www.instagram.com/chitral_patil/similar_accounts/". Similarly, you can directly replace my username "chitral_patil" with your desired user. Not to mention a follow on my My Instagram Account would also be nice.

## NOTE
Overusing this code will have its own ramifications, so make sure that you don't follow more than 35 people in one go. I've randomized the interval between 2 sec and 3.5 sec as a safety net. Feel free to change everything in the code but decrease the time interval. I am not responsible for any repercussions from running this code. So please do your own due diligence.

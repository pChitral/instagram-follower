# Automatically Follow Users on Instagram
## How to use this?
All you need is a web browser in order to use this code. 
1. Press "ctrl + shift + I" or manually open the console of your browser.
2. Copy paste the code form the instagramFollow.js file.

## Things to remember
Use this code after clicking "See All" which sits right next to the "Suggestions For You", which gets displayed immediately as you log into you account using browser.
However, this code works perfectly fine when run specifically for a user where the url looks like "https://www.instagram.com/{username of the account that you clicked}/similar_accounts/"


## NOTE  
Overusing this code will have it's own ramifications so make sure that you don't follow more than 35 people in one go. 
As a safety net, I've randomized the inerval between 2 sec and 3.5 sec. Feel free to do anything with the code but decrease the time interval.
I am not responsible for any repurcussions from running this code. So please do your own due diligence.
